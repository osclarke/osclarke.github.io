<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h1>

<p>I have been wanting to make a website for quite some time now. However, the issue has always been: What do I put on It?</p>

<p>I am currently a Junior in high school so Iâ€™ve started to begin thinking about colleges and future jobs. I had a sort of epiphany. My website should be about me, showcasing my interests, accomplishments, and ideas. It would act as a portfolio or resume site. It was perfect!</p>

<p>By building, designing, and deploying my own website I hope to showcase a level of competance with HTML &amp; CSS as well as various other technologies. This site also serves as a perfect platform to showcase photography, a skill that Iâ€™m anxious to learn. Further, I can showcase future recordings and performances done on my cello as well as decscribe my progress on the instrument.</p>

<p>Overall I felt this was the purpose medium to explore ideas, projects, and talents and share them with the world.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>

<p>My name is Owen Stewart Clarke. I am a current junior in high school. I have a broad range of interests but some of these include: music (I play the cello), programming and computer systems, and photography.</p>

<p>I currently live in the suburbs of Philadelphia Pennsylvania but have lived around the world. I spent two years in Germany and two years in China. During that time I had the oppurtunity to travel to eighteen countries around the world. With this experience I have grown a fascination towards languages and cultures around the world. I currently take German but would like to study both Madarin (Chinese) and Arabic in the furture.</p>
