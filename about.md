# Hello World!

I have been wanting to make a website for quite some time now. However, the issue has always been: What do I put on It?

I am currently a Junior in high school so I've started to begin thinking about colleges and future jobs. I had a sort of epiphany. My website should be about me, showcasing my interests, accomplishments, and ideas. It would act as a portfolio or resume site. It was perfect!

By building, designing, and deploying my own website I hope to showcase a level of competance with HTML & CSS as well as various other technologies. This site also serves as a perfect platform to showcase photography, a skill that I'm anxious to learn. Further, I can showcase future recordings and performances done on my cello as well as decscribe my progress on the instrument.

Overall I felt this was the purpose medium to explore ideas, projects, and talents and share them with the world.

## Who Am I?

My name is Owen Stewart Clarke. I am a current junior in high school. I have a broad range of interests but some of these include: music (I play the cello), programming and computer systems, and photography.

I currently live in the suburbs of Philadelphia Pennsylvania but have lived around the world. I spent two years in Germany and two years in China. During that time I had the oppurtunity to travel to eighteen countries around the world. With this experience I have grown a fascination towards languages and cultures around the world. I currently take German but would like to study both Madarin (Chinese) and Arabic in the furture.
